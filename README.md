# Introduction 
Car Configurator was a learning project as an introduction to asp.net.
I used ASP.NET MVC for the backend, knockout.js for client side ui bindings, SQL Server for the database and bootstrap and less for a simple UI.
The website is build with responsive design using the built-in bootstrap classes.
